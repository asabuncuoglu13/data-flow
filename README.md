# Data Privacy Practices Cards

The goal of the project is to inform users about the data privacy, security, usage, analysis, interpretation practices while browsing social media web pages. 

## Integrate Cards to Your Web Application

Add the following files to your web application:
````
./card/dataflow.js
./card/style.css
./images
./lib
````

Use ```bindPopUpBeforeElement(_el, _popUpJSON)``` or ```bindPopUpInsideElement(_el, _popUpJSON)``` to add the popup to your HTML element. In the ``dataflow.js`` file you can see the list of available popup contents.

## Using Cards as an Educational Activity

Teachers and parents can use our _fill in the blanks_ type of cards as discussion starters. They can fill these cards together while visiting the different web pages.

Another possible activity is handing the information cards to group of students and ask them to give different examples that they encounter during their web browsing experience.
